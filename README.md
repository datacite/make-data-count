# Make Data Count
[Make Data Count](https://makedatacount.org) is an initiative that promotes open data metrics to enable the evaluation and reward of research data reuse and impact. Technical development for Make Data Count infrastructure is supported by [DataCite](https://datacite.org). 

This repository is for community feedback about Make Data Count infrastructure. At this stage, we are primarily interested in collecting feedback on the [Data Citation Corpus](https://makedatacount.org/data-citation/). Feedback will be reviewed and prioritized by the Make Data Count and DataCite teams.
